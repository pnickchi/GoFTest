\usage{
testYourModel(
  x,
  score,
  Fx,
  mle,
  ngrid = length(x),
  gridpit = FALSE,
  precision = 1e-06,
  method = "cvm"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector of length n for data points. The input must be numeric.}

\item{score}{can be a function provided by user that returns a matrix with n rows and p columns. The rows corresponds to each data point
and each column corresponds to each parameter in the model. If score is such a function, the first argument must take x (data points) and
the second argument must take a vector of mle estiamte of parameters. The function must return a matrix of n rows and p columns. testYourModel
function tries apply score function with mle as input to calculate score matrix.
The score input can instead be a matrix with n rows and p columns.}

\item{Fx}{can be a function to calculate the probability inverse transform of data.
A user provided function to calculate probability inverse transform of vector data, x. The first argument must be
vector of data values, x. The second argument must be a vector of unknown parameters. The number of parameters in this function
must match the number of parameters in score function (score_fn). See details for more examples.}

\item{mle}{A vector of mle estimate (s) of the unknown parameter(s) in the model. The lenght of this vector must be the same as the number of
columns of matrix returned by score.}

\item{ngrid}{The number of equally spaced points to discritize the (0,1) interval to estimate the covariance of the stochastic process.}

\item{gridpit}{A Boolean indicator. If TRUE, ngrid is ignored and (0,1) interval is divided based on probability inverse transformed
values. If FALSE (default value), (0,1) is divided into ngrid equally spaced points to estimate process.}

\item{precision}{The theory behind GoF based on empirical distribution function (edf) works well if the mle is indeed the root of
derivative of log likelihood. The user provided score function is evaluated at mle to verify its closeness to zero.
Precision is used to check how close score function is to zero. The default value of precision is 1e-6.}

\item{method}{a character string to indicate which statistics to calculate.
The possible values are 'cvm' for Cramer-von Mises and 'ad' for Anderson-Darling.
The default value is 'cvm'.}
}
\value{
A list of two.
\itemize{
\item Statistic: The Cramer-von-Mises statistic.
\item pvalue: The approximated pvalue for the GoF test based on EDF.
}
}
\description{
This function can apply goodness of fit test based on empirical distribution function to any distribution defined by user.
The function requires score and probability transform inverse of data.
